        <h2>What is the Undergraduate Research Symposium?</h2>
        <p>
            The URS offers an opportunity for the UMM community to present research, creative work and art performances. The audience not only includes peers, faculty and family,
            but reaches far beyond the campus community. The URS continually manages to show the world what the UMM community can achieve.

        <h2>Why URSA Major?</h2>
        <p>
            When CSci 3601's students were given the task of making an application for the Undergraduate Research Symposium, they were also given the tough job of deciding
            what the application's design would be like, choosing what it would be named, and designing its capabilities. Said simply, the name URSA Major is a pun. And its goal is
            to be an organizational web application that streamlines, automates, and integrates in order to fluidly combine all aspects of the URS, including submissions,
            reviews, and the process of organizing the entire event.
